## Syllabus

### Course Description

This is a course on computational financial modeling using the Python programming language. Topics in computational finance as well as financial computing will be covered. Students will learn computational modeling with applications to option pricing and financial econometrics. Foundational concepts from computer science and software engineering will be introduced. Upon completion of the course students will have a new analytical framework for thinking about financial problem solving as well as a deep practical skill set in computational modeling.

### Prerequisites

- Stat 2300 Business Statistics 
- Math 1100/1210 Calculus
- Finance 3200 and 3400
- ___Or___ approval of the professor

Students must be prepared to program in Python for computational assignments. No prior programming experience is required! 


### Textbooks

While there are no ___required___ textbooks for the course, the following are ___strongly___ suggested. 

- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas
- [An Option Greeks Primer](https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137371669) by Jawwad Farid

<br>


### Assessment and Grading

Students will be assessed according to the following:

- Homework problems and computational assignments (35%)
    + Homework assignments will correspond with your readings
    + Python computational assignments will augment your readings
    
- A final project (50%)
    + Students may work in teams of two
    + Project topics will be announced
    + The deliverable will be a markdown document with paper and code combined
    
- A final essay (15%)
    + Topic: "What Should (Computational) Economists Do?" 
    + I will discuss this with you in class
    + The deliverable will be an markdown document 

Dates for each of these stages will be discussed in class and updated on the Google Sheet schedule. All work will handed in through GitHub. 


### Software 

Finance 5350 is taught using Python and the *Scientific Stack*, a set of core scientific computing packages written and maintained by various third parties.

#### Anaconda Python 3 Edition

The main focus of the course is the Python programming for financial modeling. We will be using the Anaconda Python
Distribution, which is free:

- [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

<br>

I will be giving detailed instructions on how to install and get Python running on your system. 

<br>

We will heavily use both `git` and [github](htts://github.io). Installation instructions and some tutorials are given on a separate page.

<br>

For Finance 5350 we will learn modern document preparation tools:

- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

<br>

I will be giving just-in-time tutorials for each of these tools as we need them. 

**NOT** Microsoft Word! Word is not allowed in Finance 5350!

#### Slack

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email. Students will be invited to the [Fin 5350 Slack channel](https://fin5350.slack.com) prior to the first week of class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be [downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client via a desktop browser.


#### Visual Studio Code Text Editor

I will be using `vscode` (when not using Vim from the command line). I highly recommend that you do as well. I will post details about downloading
[`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and configuring it for the class. I highly recommend that you install the `vscode-vim` extension for Vim emulation.
